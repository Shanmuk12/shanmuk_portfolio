*Assignments Day2:*
1. Write a program that declares two integer variables, swaps their values without using a third variable, and prints the result.
2. Create a program that simulates a simple calculator using command-line arguments to perform and print the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division..
3. Write a Java program that asks the user to enter their birth year, then calculates and prints their current age. Assume the current year is 2024.
         Expected Output: If the user inputs "1990", the program should output: "You are 34 years old."
4 . Write a Java program that asks the user to enter their weight in kilograms and height in meters, then calculates and prints their Body Mass Index (BMI). Use the formula BMI = weight / (height * height).
Expected Output: If the user inputs "70" for weight and "1.75" for height, the program should output: "Your BMI is 22.86."
5.  Write a Program to check whether entered number is Odd or Even.
6. Write a Java Program to check whether entered City is IT City or Not. Consider Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkatta, Bangalore, Chennai , Hyderabad as IT cities. create a package *assignments* and execute the above code *Assignments Day3:*
1) Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter their score (an integer between 0 and 100). The program should then print the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:
A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: 0-59
Expected Output: If the user inputs "85", the program should output: "Your grade is B."

2) Largest of Three Numbers

Question: Write a Java program that asks the user to enter three integers. The program should then determine and print the largest of the three numbers.
Expected Output: If the user inputs "12", "7", and "20", the program should output: "The largest number is 20."

3) Triangle Type
Question: Write a Java program that asks the user to enter the lengths of three sides of a triangle. The program should then determine whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal, an isosceles triangle has two sides equal, and a scalene triangle has all sides different.
Expected Output: If the user inputs "5", "5", and "5", the program should output: "The triangle is equilateral." If the user inputs "5", "5", and "7", the program should output: "The triangle is isosceles." If the user inputs "3", "4", and "5", the program should output: "The triangle is scalene."

4) Password Strength

Question: Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a password. The program should then determine the strength of the password based on the following criteria:
Strong: At least 8 characters, contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, and includes at least one digit and one special character.
Medium: At least 6 characters, contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, and includes at least one digit.
Weak: Does not meet the above criteria.
Expected Output: If the user inputs "P@ssw0rd", the program should output: "Password strength: Strong." If the user inputs "Pass123", the program should output: "Password strength: Medium." If the user inputs "pass", the program should output: "Password strength: Weak."
Reverse a Number

5) Question: Write a Java program that asks the user to enter an integer. The program should then reverse the digits of the number and print the reversed number.
Expected Output: If the user inputs "1234", the program should output: "The reversed number is 4321."

6. Prime Number Check

Question: Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter an integer. The program should then determine whether the number is prime and print the result. A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Expected Output: If the user inputs "7", the program should output: "7 is a prime number." If the user inputs "10", the program should output: "10 is not a prime number."

7.Sum of Digits

Question: Write a Java program that asks the user to enter an integer. The program should then calculate and print the sum of the digits of the entered number.
Expected Output: If the user inputs "1234", the program should output: "The sum of the digits is 10."
